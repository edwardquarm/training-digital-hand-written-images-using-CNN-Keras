## Motivation

This project was created from a Deep learning class assignment. I use the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems to train a Convoluted Neural Network to correctly identify the handwritten digits from 0-9. More information on the MNIST dataset can be found from this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database . 
Training of the data set was done using Keras, a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.
